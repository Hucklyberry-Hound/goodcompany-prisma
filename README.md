# In Good Company -- Back-end Repo
This repository contains the back-end codebase for our Capstone: In Good Company. The code on this repo interfaces to a GraphQL playground that is also hosted on heroku.
This enables our application to interact with user data through the means we intended, which is defined in our resolvers; written in plain Javascript. The Prisma library
utilizes the resolvers we created in order to query data to and from our server.
